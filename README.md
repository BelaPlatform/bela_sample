#A pattern library for Bela

##Some things still have to be done:

- radio buttons
- popup styles
- anchor tags
- fix dropdowns
- block quotes
- rules for icon use?

This pattern library mostly has very carefully styled components, as it was made to support the IDE. 

To roll this out widely across web, cross browser compatibility needs to be added (currently only webkit).
