Sample is a pattern library lays out the design and layout conventions for a brand or group of sites. This is the one for Bela.

It is highly componentised, and relies mostly on CSS3 for functionality (though it also uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and 50 lines of Javascript). It relies on the [Sass extension language](http://sass-lang.com/) for SCSS, and rolls all styles together using the included Gulp file. 

##To make changes: 

1. Fork this repo.
2. Run gulp in the repo (the gulp file is already included).
3. Write/test your SCSS.
4. Make a pull request.

###Please note:

This pattern library is designed for Chrome first, because the Bela IDE is currently Chrome-based. Therefore, the components are untested outside Chrome (the HTML and styling should render properly across browsers, but is untested). Please don't open cross-browser issues at this time, but please liberally flag up any inconsistencies in Chrome browsers!

##Some things still have to be done:

- ~~radio buttons~~ Done! 
- popup styles
- ~~anchor tags~~ Done!
- ~~fix dropdowns~~ Done!
- block quotes
- rules for icon use?
- ~~ol/ul for web use~~ Done!
